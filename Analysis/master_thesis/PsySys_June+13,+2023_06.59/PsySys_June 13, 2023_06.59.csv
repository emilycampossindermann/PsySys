While it might make it clear to people at which point in their graph they could start attacking their issues, it might not be that easy to go through with it. Also it might suggest that they could do this without professional help, which seems dangerous in some cases (note that one of examples involved self-harm). Maybe some added suggestion of discussing the graph with a professional for help with further identifying and attacking the root causes might be helpful. Also it somewhat leaves out other categories of root causes outside of the control of the individual (trauma, physical issues etc.)."

The constant summarization and repetition was perfect. In one of the diagrams in my opinion a node for 'intrusive thoughts' was missing between 'shame' and 'no focus' or should be at least mentioned. Some concepts like arising comorbidities should be mentioned as contributing new emerging factors. A vital point would also be that many use mental distress as excuse for things not going according to plan and start self identifying with it and feel powerless to do anything against it because that bears the risk of being more of a failure and having the excuse is easy and often is only self diagnosed which is highly advised against because of lack of differential diagnosis.
